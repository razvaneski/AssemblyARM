# AssemblyARM

Debian-based tool for running Assembly x86 on ARM machines, using Docker.

Created for Macs using Apple Silicon. May or may not work on other ARM devices.

# How do I install it?

Download Docker Desktop and go to this [link](https://hub.docker.com/r/razvaneski/assemblyarm) on Docker Hub. It's that easy!

Or, if you're already familiar with Docker, use this command:
`docker pull razvaneski/assemblyarm`

Of course, you can also download this Dockerfile and build it yourself.
